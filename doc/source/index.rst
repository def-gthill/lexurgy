Lexurgy
=======

Lexurgy is a toolkit for conlangers. It currently has two components:

- Gen, a word generator. Currently, this is a direct imitation of Awkwords, but available offline.
- SC, a sound change simulator. This is inspired by Rosenfelder's SCA and Bangs' Phonix, but has important features both of them lack.

A third component - Flex, an inflection simulator - is under development.
